* Overview

buffer-timer is a utility to keep track of the time spent in a series
of emacs buffers.  You can then collectively group buffers into tasks
and thus keep track of your overall time spent per project, for
example.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'buffer-timer)

; Example list of titles and regexps to group by.  This
(setq buffer-timer-regexp-master-list
  '(
    ("idle" . 
     (("generic" .			  "^\\*idle\\*")
      ("generic2" .			  "^\\*idle-2\\*")
      ("minibuf" .                        "^ \\*Minibuf-.*")))
    ("personal" .
     (("reading" .                        "lib/ebooks/")

* History

Originally written for XEmacs, with a pretty "top (gutter) bar" it has
since migrated to Emacs where it still is missing some of the original
functionality.  The button code and "top bar" functionality needs to
be rewritten entirely.
